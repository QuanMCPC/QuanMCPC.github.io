            <h1>It seems like you're offline!</h1>
            <h4>Hello user.</h4>
            <p>Maybe your power got cut off, maybe you haven't pay the Internet bill, or maybe, just maybe, you using Wifi from your neighbor and the neighbor found out about it and decide to change the password.</p>
            <p>But anyway, you're offline. That's a bad thing, right? Now, if you're using browser like Chrome you might expecting a dino to show up and then you press Spacebar and you play a game about a dino running and you have to avoid the dino from hitting the obstacle. Or you might get a different thing or game or even just a simple message instead from different browser.</p>
            <p>But on my website, you can draw instead when you're offline. The paint program is actually a project that I've work on which is SOOPE, it's listed in the Home page. And the best thing is that this will show up on almost all browser (as long as the address is my website address).</p>
            <p>Sincerely, the creator of the website: QuanMCPC</p>
